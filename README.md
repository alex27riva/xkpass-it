## Word Lists

This project uses the [word lists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases) for random passphrases provided by EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation). EFF's long word list is used by default, though all three of their word lists are available. A custom word list can also be used by passing the path to it.
